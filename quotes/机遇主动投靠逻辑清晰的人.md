	I know lots of people who've been staggeringly successful and watched them throughout my life.

	Those people, you don't want to have an argument with them. They'll just slash you into pieces. And not in a malevolent way. 

	It's like if you're going to make your point and ther're going to make their point. you better have your points organized, because otherwise you are going to look like and be absolute idiot. You are not going to get anywhere.

	And if you can formulate your arguments coherently and make a presentation, if you can speak to people, if you can lay out a proposal. God， people give you money,they give you opportunities.

	You need to learn to think.

	Because thinking makes you act effectivey in the world.

	Thinking makes you win the battles you undertake and those could be battles for good things. If you can think and speak and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way.

	So that's why learn to write.
