	One of the things that's very important to note about stress is that stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over.
	
	So if I find some particular thing is causing me to have stress. this's a warning flag for me. what it means is there's something that I haven't completely identified perhaps in my conscious mind. that is bothering me and I haven't yet taken any action on it.
	
	I find as soon as identify it and make the first phone call or send off the first email message or whatever it is that we're gonna do to start to address that situation. even if it's not solved, nere fact that we're addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from.
	
	Stress doesn't come from hard work.
	
	For example you know you can do working incredibly hard and loving it. And likewise, you can be out of work and incredibly stressed over that. So... and likewise if you kind of use the, you know ,use that as an analogy for what I was just talking about.
	
	If you're out of work but you're going through, you know, a disciplined approach of a series of job interviews and so on and working to remedy that situation. you're going to be a lot less stressed than if you're just worrying about it and doing nothing.
